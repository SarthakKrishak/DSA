We have mainly three types of variables in recursion - 1.In the argument.
                                                       2.In the return type.
                                                       3.Body of the function.

So you should know where to give these variables during recursion.

If you want to use the variable in the next call then give it in argument.

Now we will take the example of the binary search,

what we do in binary search we can do that same thing with recursion as well

Recursive relation,
F(n) = F(n/2) + O(1)

This F(n/2) is for dividing the array in half
and O(1) is for comparisions


Types of recurrance relation,
1. Linear --> ex is fibonacci
2. Divide and conquere ---> ex is binary search
