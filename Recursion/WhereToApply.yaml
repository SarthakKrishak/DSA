1. Identify if you can break the problem into samller problems.
2. Write the recurence relation if needed.
3. Draw the recursive tree.
4. About the tree,
    -  See the flow of functions how they are getting in stack
    - Identify and focus on left tree cells and right tree cells
    - Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper
    - Use a debugger to see the process
5. See how the values (and what type of values(int,string etc)) are returned at each step and see where the function call will come out of.
6. In the end you will come out of the main function.
