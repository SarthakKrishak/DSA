Why Recursion ?

It helps us in solving bigger and complex problems in a simple way.

you can convert recursion solution into iterations and vice versa.

Space complexity is not constant because of recursice calls.


Visualizing the recursion,(Recursion Tree)

main()-->print(1)-->print(2)-->print(3)-->print(4)-->print(5)

After completion of the program,
program over<--main()<--print(1)<--print(2)<--print(3)<--print(4)<--print(5)


Also one type of recursion is "tail" recursion
