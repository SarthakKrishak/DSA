Time:
Best Case = O(N)
Worst Case = O(N^2)

It puts the the index element at the correct index of the LHS.

=> For the first pass,
Sort the array till index 1 

=> For the second pass,
Sort the array till index 2

and similarly...

and it will break if the j is greater than j-1 and it will not check the previous elements.

Why we use it-
1)No of swaps are reduced as compared to bubble sort.
2) Its stable.
3) Used for smaller values of N and works good when the array is partially sorted.
4) It takes part in hybrid sorting algo.
