// The basic logic is that if you want to find the ith bit of any nnumber then if you do and operation btw that ith bit and 1 then you will get that bit only.

// suppose if we have to find the 5th bit in the following ,
//        1011010
//Now if we want that the following should have AND operation with the above.
//        0010000
// This above is called "Mask".
// To create this we just 1 << 4
